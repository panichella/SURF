Description of the content of folder "SURF_replication_package":
1) "Experiment I" contains:
   a) the folder "summaries" which contains all the html summaries generated through SURF 
      and browsed by study participants involved in the Experiment I.
   b) the folder "XMLreviews" which contains, for each of the apps involved in the Experiment I, 
      the corresponding XML file containing all the collected reviews for that app. These xml files have been used 
      as input files for the SURF tool for generating the summaries contained in 
      the "summaries" folder

      and browsed by study participants in the Experiment II.
   b) the folder "XMLreviews" which contains, for each of the two apps involved in the Experiment II, 
      the corresponding XML file containing all the collected reviews for that app. These xml files have been used 
      as input of the SURF tool for generating the summaries contained in 
      the "summaries" folder.

      extracted/validated by survey participants in the two sub-experiments.
   d) "Experiment_II_survey_answers.xlsx" which contains all the answers to our
