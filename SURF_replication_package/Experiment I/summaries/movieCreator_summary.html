	case 51:  reviewText="Hello. Happy to attend another beta, let's listen to the users as well as the professionals and keep it constructive. My main concerns at this point is the functionality of the app if you put it up against the move maker from the older generations. From the start I simply missed the feature to not automatically generate those movies at all since not all my photos are good memories, but still very important to keep for later reference. I love the features added to the beta, but it seems like I can't choose how mutch of a clip I want or how long each photo is on for. I absolutely love that you now can remove and change what goes on the move, and that you can select music is priceless. I have used quite a few video editors for computers, but there is no reason I can't use this app for my rather simple musicvideoes in the future if a few things gets a bit refined. Like for music selection you can set start point, but only to the closest second. I understand that eventually this feature will be available for videos, but if you can set points with greater accuracy lipsync would be within range. I understand that my needs are a bit outside normal, but one thing that I think everyone would enjoy would be to decide whether or not the audio from the videos are playing and maybe volume. I am yet to realy put it to the test, but I have used the app from the beginning, but never really enjoyed any of the movies until the beta features where added. Got to admit my life is rather tragic, but highlights from my life will be totally awesome when I can remove some of the not so bright moments since my phone is yet to understand witch captured moments I find beautiful and truly can be remembered as a highlight from my life"; appVersion=""; user="SiD Rhyte"; title=""; date=""; rating=""; break;

I can't say it's not picking any videos at all, but it tends to pick still images from any folder rather than my videos. My last 3 highlights entirely consist of images, despite the fact that I'm agressively recording videos for MC (my sdcard has more videos than photos). I know restrictions on videos, I always shoot at standard mode (no 4k or too short videos).-it starts to include Whatsapp videos and images, which is generally not related to my highlights, and there is no options to stop it.-it is just creates chronologically correct slideshows, old versions (and without using sdcard back then) was more creative, video based ones.-There is no menu item to check application version number.Thank you for this great app, and I'm eagerly waiting for next version."; appVersion=""; user="Arda Erdikmen"; title=""; date=""; rating=""; break;
