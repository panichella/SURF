The behavior of the app when data traffic is unavailable. The offline search has been there all the time but many users seem to have missed that offline (pending) search is possible. We have addressed this by improving the information when no network is available.3. The TrackID-charts is extended a bit more than the current 10 top items. The interesting variations in the charts actually happens a bit further down in the lists. Have a look and tell us what you think about longer charts.Of course we always appreciate feedback on things that do not work as well.Stay tuned, the new version is coming soon!"; appVersion=""; user="Johan Liedholm"; title=""; date=""; rating=""; break;

I keep use old version because the new version can't do this. please make new version can recognize song from internal speaker. I think users will love this fiture- trackid once had a text search fiture. but why was that fiture deleted? it's a very nice fiture. sometimes I know a song title but I forgot the artist name or I want to know the album title. with this fiture, i don't need to use 'tap to recognze'. I just need to search it with text. it's easier (and save more internet quota). please return this fiture.- I don't like the design of the homepage. I suggest to return the history menu.or if you can't (idk why) i suggest to change the design. I think it's more lovely if the album art smaller. so the album art arranged into 2 colomn. and the song title and the artist written below it. and also i don't like the- There's 'Search on youtube' button below the song's detail. I suggest to add 'Search lyrics on google' and 'Search song on google play music' or 'Search song on google' to download it :d. And add 'Search artist info on wikipedia' below the artist info.- Instead of our history, I think it's better to show our favorites artist' update, their post on social media, their newest song or video, etc. that will be great- In artist info, please add their post on twitter, facebook or even instagram. add their video on youtube.- I want trackid is not only a song detector.

Why not move it into the other options section to sit above legal? 2. That signed in page says your full history is stored on the history page. The only place I can see my history is on the homepage, which doesn't show my full archive. 3. A search option would be great. After tracking a song, you sometimes want to explore similar artists. It limits its usefulness as a music discovery tool not having this. 4. More artist, album and song meta data would be great.

	case 87:  reviewText="I just joined this beta program and I stressed a bit the application: what I like most is the possibility to play most of the recognised songs on Spotify. I have the premium there and I'm not interested in using other platforms. However roughly 40% of songs played (from spotify) didn't had the link to spotify, which is kinda weird because I was playing them from... Spotify, on PC.Also, i found the recognition strong in particular on classical music if compared with other platforms (I mean, those software are NEVER good enough on classical, but I made a selective comparative with Google music search, shazam and soundcloud, and TrackID is the best one right now), but weak in everything else. It's weakness is particularly evident in movies soundtracks when there was no way to have recognised songs about ultra famous movies and authors, like Morricone, Zimmer and Tiersen. Even with indie music (always available on spotify, only tracks with rating >40000) it has serious issues. No problem with famous rock and pop songs. Expecially with pop songs it's lightning fast, but the song has to be very mainstream. I suggest the killer feature could be a way to train it, like the possibility to give it a link with the source it wasn't able to recognise. (maybe from filtered sources, like Google play music or spotify, to avoid the risk to learn from a low quality content).(I personally developed a similar system for patent data mining and contextual search, and after 1 year of development without significant improvements, giving it the patent and make it learn from the source it wasn't able to discover was the best solution to improve the performance). Anyway, I personally appreciate the ease to use and the interface. I'm sure it has the potential to become one of the best software out there, but it still need a lot of work.I hope my small feedback could be helpful."; appVersion=""; user="Samuele Farfarini"; title=""; date=""; rating=""; break;

For Japanese music it could be nice to put the Metadata of the song in something more readable (the equivalent of the Japanese words) when the phone is not in Japanese. 2.
