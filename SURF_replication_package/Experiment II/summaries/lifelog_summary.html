	case 32:  reviewText="Hi, I have some feedback on my Lifelog experiences.  I own the following products:Xperia Tablet Z3 CompactSony Smartwatch 3Google Nexus 5The watch is on my all the time, the phone most of the time. Much of my music listening is via my phone.Obviously my phone not being an Xperia, means it doesn't log music listening, even if it was an Xperia, I don't want to use Walkman, I prefer to use Google Music all access, whic Lifelog doesn't monitor (at least not on my Xperia tablet).I also find that despite wearing my Smartwatch3, it doesn't track cycling. Apparently again, I need an Xperia phone to do that, which doesn't seem correct, as Google Fit tracks my activity just fine both on my watch and my Nexus5.I hope to see less restrictions in future versions of Lifelog, and embrace the Google apps more. (being able to read Google Fit data would be a great start)"; appVersion=""; user="Mark Gillespie"; title=""; date=""; rating=""; break;
	case 33:  reviewText="Also, there is another issue that happens regardless of the device used: the automatic night mode comes in even if you are walking in the street, therefore if you forget to manually switch it back to day mode (with the danger to forget to switch back to night when you go to bed) it appears as sleep time during which you are awake and does not count your burnt calories during all that time. I think it should detect when you are awake and moving and better adjust automatically the set night/day mode accordingly. But that maybe depends more on the smartband device than on the application.That has another danger: that you manually turn the day mode on at night , and then forget to switch it back to night when you go to bed: then it does not register you as asleep even though there is no motion for hours. Maybe it should automatically return to night mode when you are not moving and it is within that time frame that you set as night automatically. In fact, the instructions say it automatically adjusts night/day according to your motions besides the automatically set hours, but it doesn't do that, or at least it doesn't do it during the night time. It seems to do that only when you wake up in the morning it goes to day time mode even if it's still within the hours set as night in the automatic night setting.Other than that, I'm enjoying the smartband features."; appVersion=""; user="Fanny M"; title=""; date=""; rating=""; break;

	case 36:  reviewText="I love the app, it's a great idea, but imagine having cloud technology working to its full potential. If I am a Sony consumer, it's due to all its devices and possibilties available. For example, I have an Xperia smartphone, meaning I have a walking Camera, so my photos that are stored in PlayMemories, should be available in my Lifelog also, and vice a versa. Also, if I have my Playstation 4, and an app that tells me how much I have been playing games, Why can't the Playstation connect to my SEN and tell my Lifelog that I have been playing for x amount of time? I have the app onmy mobile, it tells me everything, so it should be able to keep up to date with that too."; appVersion=""; user="Gary Paul Lynch Garcia"; title=""; date=""; rating=""; break;

Maybe I could buy a hammock instead of a bed or a motorbike or Lear jet instead of the camper van graphic. I want to customise my life log character and I want to be motivated.

I went for a walk at midnight of the 17th with my friend amassing roughly 6k steps. My phone was on low battery mode so 4G wasn't on (but lifelog, z3, and smartband talk were still on). When I later charged it, my smartband talk reset to 0 steps. However, the lifelog app still included the 6k steps from earlier...

	case 50:  reviewText="+Lifelog Beta hello. Just joined the community. I think the idea of lifelog is quite good, but suggest some important futures to enhance the fitness tracking capabilities e.g. closing the gap with GFit, endomondo etc etc.....1) add possibility to log sports other then running. E.g. you can swim with the band, but cannot record swimming 2) manually adjust steps if needed / add sports 3) improve recognition of public transport. App confuse bus with running.
